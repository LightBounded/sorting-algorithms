# Sorting Algorithms

This repo contains the implementation of five common sorting algoritms: bubble, selection, insertion, quick, and merge sort.

I've created c programs for each one asking for an input $n$ representing the length of the array that will be randomly generated, which will then be sorted using the algorithm in the file name of the program.

## Get Started

To use this project, simply compile one of the programs using gcc and run the executable.

### Example

```sh
gcc quick-sort.c # Compile program
./a.out          # Run executable
```

| Input         | Output                                                                         |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10 <br/><br/> | Before: 33 33 55 13 53 57 9 31 45 95 <br/> After: 9 13 31 33 33 45 53 55 57 95 |
