# Sorting Algorithms

This repo contains the implementation of five common sorting algoritms: bubble, selection, insertion, quick, and merge sort.

I've created c programs for each one asking for an input $n$ representing the length of the array that will be randomly generated, which will then be sorted using the algorithm in the file name of the program.

## Get Started

To use this project, simply compile one of the programs using gcc and run the executable.

### Ex.

```sh
gcc quick-sort.c # Compile program
./a.out          # Run executable
```
